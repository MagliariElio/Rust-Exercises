# Rust Exercises
This is a repository where you can find exercises for the Rust programming language with the own text and a related personal solution. 

They will be exercises to learn how to program in Rust so very basic. 

In addition, I suppose that all's properly installed and running on your computer. (e.g.  rustup, an ide well configured ...).
In my case, I'm using CLion as IDE to program in Rust.

Finally, the exercises will be loaded with new ones over time. If you want to add new one to the collection, please follow the same organization of the other projects.

Implement a program that will compute the Fibonacci sequence.
Below, is the Fibonacci formula:

{
    f_1 = 1
    f_2 = 1
    f_n = f_(n-1) + f_(n-2)     n >= 3
}

For example:
    f_3 = 2 = 1 + 1
    f_4 = 3 = 2 + 1
    f_5 = 5 = 3 + 2
    f_6 = 8 = 5 + 3
    f_7 = 13 = 8 + 5
    f_8 = 21 = 13 + 8
    ....

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 13, 21, ...
